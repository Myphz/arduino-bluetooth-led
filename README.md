# Arduino LED Bluetooth controller
This project showcase an example of a server and client using Bluetooth Low Energy connection.

## Server
The server sends the peripheral a random number, from 22 to 25, each representing a color every second.

## Client
The client listens for message from the server and turns on the given LED.

This project must be run with 2 different Arduino Nano BLE boards.
Tested with 2x Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
